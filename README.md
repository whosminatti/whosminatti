## About me
<p>
  I’m passionate about technology and innovation, with a strong drive to make a positive impact on people’s lives.
</p>
<p>
  I hold a degree in Information Systems from UNISUL, where I have reinforced skills in programming, infrastructure, analysis, troubleshooting, problem-solving and incident resolution.
</p>
<p>
Currently, I work as a DevOps Engineer at Cresol, one of Brazil’s leading financial cooperatives, where I directly support over 900,000 members. Before this, I also worked as a Site Reliability Engineer at a major legal software company, where I managed infrastructure growth, created and maintained deployment and automation scripts, contributed to software architecture documentation, set up and monitored various environments, and provided support to deployment and development teams.

</p><p>
I am always seeking to learn new technologies and improve maintenance workflows. I am not just looking for personal growth, but also on a mission to help people and organizations achieve their goals and realize their full potential.
