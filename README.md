<p>
  I have been passionate about technology since I was 7 years old, when my dad bought our first PC.
  I am always eager to learn about new technologies and how to apply them to enhance maintenance processes.
  I will complete my degree in Information Systems at UNISUL in the first semester of 2024, where I strengthened my knowledge and skills in programming, infrastructure, analysis, and problem-solving.

  Currently, I work at Softplan with SAJ, the justice automation system, and together we continue to make a positive impact on peopleâ€™s lives while also improving the Brazilian justice system.
